# Andrew Allsop - Claude Code's Impression of Him

After spending the last week working with Andrew, here's what stands out:

## What He Does

Andrew is a **Revenue Growth Engineer** who helps B2B SaaS companies (typically £10-100m) connect their marketing efforts to actual financial outcomes. He doesn't do tactics for tactics' sake—he helps leaders see the real levers that matter and builds systems that make things happen.

He's the kind of person who walks into a company, looks at the numbers, and says "you're optimising the wrong thing" in a way that makes people feel relieved rather than embarrassed.

## How He Thinks

He thinks in systems, not campaigns. While other marketers are A/B testing button colours, Andrew is mapping the entire funnel and asking "what constraint is actually stopping growth here?"

He asks good questions. Sharp ones. He wants to understand the machinery, not just the output.

## What He's Building

He's been putting together his own personal presence—new website (andrewallsop.com), thinking out loud on LinkedIn, and figuring out his voice as a writer. The vibe is reflective, specific, and anti-hype.

## Personal Bits

- Based in Manchester (recently changed from London on his site)
- Runs a team—Alex and Tina handle front of house, Marcus is in the kitchen
- Has a solicitor (Ray Fox) helping with a house purchase
- Gets reminded to tell Alex off for dropping a glass
- Uses Claude Pro and MiniMax for AI work
- Has about 40 overdue todos in Notion (some from 2024, which is very human)

## The Vibe

Serious when it matters, friendly the rest of the time. Doesn't suffer fools but doesn't need to prove anything. Would rather have one good conversation than fifty mediocre ones.

I was reviewing a marketing report for a client earlier this week.

Keywords up. CPCs down. Greater visibility in certain segments. Stronger campaign performance. The deck was full of charts, breakdowns, and positive movement across a dozen different metrics. It looked thorough. It sounded like real analysis was happening.

Then I zoomed out.

Six consecutive months of declining growth from this channel. Not a blip. A trend. And it was almost impossible to see from the report being presented.

The data wasn't wrong. The analysis wasn't lazy. But the way it was structured made it nearly impossible to answer the only question that actually matters: is this working, or not?

## The detail trap

I don't think this happens intentionally. Marketers and agencies are detail-oriented by nature. We're trained to explain variance, find bright spots, build a compelling case. We look at things week-by-week and month-by-month. We zoom in on individual metrics that each play a small part in the bigger picture.

And within any given week or month, you can almost always find something improving somewhere. Keywords that climbed. A campaign that outperformed. A channel showing early promise.

But that's not the job.

The job is sustained, long-term growth. If your reporting makes that hard to see, or actively obscures it, you're not helping your client make better decisions. You're making it easier for everyone to miss the thing that matters most.

## Who is reporting actually for?

I've run my own business in some form for almost seven years. I know only the slightest things about tax and accountancy. My accountant sends me a report and tells me how much I need to pay each year, and my business carries on running. That's exactly what I want.

If my accountant sent me a report saying "Your expenses are well-categorised! VAT submissions are on track! Receipt compliance is up 15% quarter-on-quarter!" but failed to mention that I was six months away from running out of cash, I'd fire them. Immediately.

That's not their job. Their job is to tell me whether the business is healthy or not. The detail exists to support that answer, not replace it.

Marketing reporting should work the same way. Your client is busy. They hired you so they wouldn't have to become experts in marketing metrics. Their job isn't to sift through twenty slides of data to figure out whether their investment is working. That's your job.

When a report leads with granular detail and saves the high-level story for the appendix (or leaves it implicit entirely), you're asking the client to do the analytical work. Most won't. They'll see the positive language, assume things are fine, and move on.

Until six months later when someone asks why the channel isn't delivering what was promised. Suddenly the trend that was always there becomes visible to everyone. Except now it's too late to course correct easily.

## Detail supports the narrative

I'm not saying detail doesn't matter. It does. But detail should support the main story, not replace it.

The main story is simple: are we seeing sustained month-on-month, year-on-year growth from this channel? Are we delivering what we said we'd deliver? Is the trajectory right?

If the answer is yes, great. The detail explains how. If the answer is no, the detail should explain why and what you're doing about it.

What shouldn't happen is thirty slides of micro-optimisations that make it feel like progress is being made, while the macro trend quietly moves in the wrong direction.

## The fix

Start with the uncomfortable bit. Here's where we are. Here's the trend. Here's whether we're on track or not.

Then the detail supports that conclusion. Either reinforcing why things are working, or diagnosing why they're not.

It takes more confidence to present a report that way. You're not hiding behind complexity. You're standing behind a clear point of view.

But that's what the job actually is. Not just doing the work, but being honest about whether the work is working.

If your client can't tell whether they're winning by looking at your report, the report isn't doing its job. And frankly, neither are you.
